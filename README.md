## Microservices Architecture

To have a thorough understanding of microservices architecture, start with these talks:

- [GOTO 2014 | Microservices | Martin Fowler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgdBVIX9ifA)
- [Cubes, Hexagons, Triangles, and More: Understanding Microservices by Chris Richardson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMDjuXTQVkk)

There's an intro microservices course on LinkedIn Learning.

[Microservices Foundations - LinkedIn Learning Course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/microservices-foundations)

Now that we know what microservices are, let's get a little technical. There's a good short playlist on YouTube that explains the core microservices concepts.

Let's explore these concepts further.

### Communication
To learn synchronous and asynchronous communication between the microservices, here are some good resources.

 [Microservices + Events + Docker = A Perfect Trio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSm2dRarhPo)

 [GOTO 2019 | Not Just Events: Developing Asynchronous Microservices | Chris Richardson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyNL7yCvQQc)

There's a course on LinkedIn Learning about asynchronous messaging between microservices.

### Deployment

### Data Consistency

As a pre-req for microservices data consistency, you should know about these concepts.

[Distributed Data Stores](###Distributed-Data-Stores)

[SQL vs NoSQL databases](####SQL-vs-NoSQL-Databases)

[ACID vs BASE](####ACID-vs-BASE)


Then, we can learn about managing data between microservices. These are some good resources.

## Cloud Native Development

### Docker

Let's start with Learning Docker.

### Kubernetes

For learning Kubernetes, there's an excellent learning path on LinkedIn Learning.

[Master Cloud-Native Infrastructure with Kubernetes](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/master-cloud-native-infrastructure-with-kubernetes)

It has the following courses that explore topics such as microservices, cloud native ecosystem, cncf tools, monitoring and service meshes. The last course in this learning path is great to learn about Istio which is kubernetes service mesh layer to connect, secure, control and observe services.

## Full Stack Polyglot Web Development

> Polyglot developers have the ability to master, or have already mastered, developing in multiple programming languages

First, we start as an introduction to polyglot development and how to be an expert generalist. Then we'll focus on specific resources about Javascript and Python web development.
