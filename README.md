## Microservices Architecture

To have a thorough understanding of microservices architecture, start with these talks:

- [GOTO 2014 | Microservices | Martin Fowler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgdBVIX9ifA)
- [Cubes, Hexagons, Triangles, and More: Understanding Microservices by Chris Richardson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMDjuXTQVkk)

There's an intro microservices course on LinkedIn Learning.

[Microservices Foundations - LinkedIn Learning Course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/microservices-foundations)

Now that we know what microservices are, let's get a little technical. There's a good short playlist on YouTube that explains the core microservices concepts.

Let's explore these concepts further.

### Communication
To learn synchronous and asynchronous communication between the microservices, here are some good resources.

 [Microservices + Events + Docker = A Perfect Trio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSm2dRarhPo)

 [GOTO 2019 | Not Just Events: Developing Asynchronous Microservices | Chris Richardson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyNL7yCvQQc)

There's a course on LinkedIn Learning about asynchronous messaging between microservices.

### Deployment

### Data Consistency

As a pre-req for microservices data consistency, you should know about these concepts.

[Distributed Data Stores](###Distributed-Data-Stores)

[SQL vs NoSQL databases](####SQL-vs-NoSQL-Databases)

[CAP theorem](####CAP-Theorem)

[ACID vs BASE](####ACID-vs-BASE)


Then, we can learn about managing data between microservices. These are some good resources.
