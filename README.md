# Learning Modern Backend Tech!

This is a guide for learning modern backend tech around these areas:
- Microservices Architecture
- Cloud Native Development
- Full Stack Polyglot Web Development
- Serverless Services
- Tools and Techs


## Microservices Architecture

To have a thorough understanding of microservices architecture, start with these talks:

- [GOTO 2014 | Microservices | Martin Fowler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgdBVIX9ifA)
- [Cubes, Hexagons, Triangles, and More: Understanding Microservices by Chris Richardson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMDjuXTQVkk)

There's an intro microservices course on LinkedIn Learning.

[Microservices Foundations - LinkedIn Course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/microservices-foundations)

Now that we know what microservices are, let's get a little technical. There's a good short playlist on YouTube that explains the core microservices concepts.

Let's explore these concepts further.

### Communication
To learn synchronous and asynchronous communication between the microservices, here are some good resources.
